## Hi 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer based in London. I'm interested in building intuitive interfaces. I also enjoy experimenting with web3 and exploring new tech across the whole stack.

I'm currently working at [Alectro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alectro-io/) as a Frontend Developer, helping create a platform that allows companies to understand, and take responsibility of their environmental impact.
