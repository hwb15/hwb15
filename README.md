## Hi I'm Harry 👋

I've just graduated from **University of Brighton** 📝 with a First Class Honours 🥇  in Computer Science. I have built <a href="https://www.hwbuk.me/projects/fizzit">mock e-commerce websites</a>, <a href="https://www.hwbuk.me/projects/uradio-android">radio applications for Android</a> and currently focusing on the projects listed below under **Projects I'm currently working on**.

<h3> 🔧 Projects I'm currently working on</h3>

- <h4>Building on my web3 skills!</h4>

  <p>I've been learning how to build smart contracts, how to interact with smart contracts from a frontend, and everything in between! Fairly deep into the ever evolving rabbit hole of blockchain development.</p> 
  
- <h4>[___] Radio App</h4>

  <p>Building on an original idea from previous work - building using React Native with a different focus and features. To be released soon, currently in 'stealth' development.</p>
